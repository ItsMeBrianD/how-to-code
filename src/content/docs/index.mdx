## About the Course

This course will take you from little to no programming experience, to being able to create
simple to moderately complex web apps using Typescript, Svelte, TailwindCSS, and Postgres, using 
industry best practices and design patterns when applicable.

The goal throughout this course is to learn both the _how_, as well as the _why_ behind the tools,
concepts, and patterns that we'll be using. If you focus on learning the concepts, and why choices
are made, not only will your code be more maintainable, but you will be able to transfer your
learning here to other languages and frameworks.
