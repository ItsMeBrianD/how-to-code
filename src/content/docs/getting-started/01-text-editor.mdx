Before you write any code, it's important to set up a good environment to help you succeed. Picking the right tools
for the job will help you write, navigate, and debug your code more efficiently.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use just about any text editor for writing code, but some are better
  suited than others.

There are two main software categories for editing code, _text editors_ and _integrated development environments_ (we'll refer to these as IDEs going forward).

## Text Editors

Text editors are lightweight tools primarily designed for editing plain text or writing code.
They are typically highly customizable with plugins and themes, making them adaptable to various workflows.

### Pros:

- **Lightweight**: Quick to open and use, consuming minimal system resources.
- **Customizable**: Support for plugins and extensions to enhance functionality.
- **Language Agnostic**: General-purpose and not tied to a specific programming language.
- **Free or Affordable**: Many are open-source or have free versions.

### Cons:

- **Limited Debugging Tools**: Lack built-in debugging features found in IDEs.
- **Manual Configuration**: May require setup for advanced features like IntelliSense or linting.
- **Basic Project Management**: Unsuitable for handling large codebases seamlessly.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and PyCharm are comprehensive tools offering a single platform for code writing, debugging, running, and testing. They typically cater to specific programming languages or frameworks.

### Pros

- **All-in-One**: Bundled with editors, debuggers, compilers, and other tools.
- **Advanced Features**: Autocompletion, real-time error detection, and refactoring tools.
- **Better Debugging Support**: Integrated debugging environments for a seamless experience.
- **Project Organization**: Ideal for handling larger, complex projects.

### Cons

- **Resource-Intensive**: Requires more memory and processing power.
- **Steeper Learning Curve**: Beginners may find them overwhelming due to numerous features.
- **Language-Specific**: Often optimized for specific languages or ecosystems.
- **Cost**: Many advanced IDEs have licensing fees or premium versions.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you're just getting started, use VSCode. It's free, fast, and
  beginner-friendly. You won’t hit any major limitations until much later - and
  many professional developers rely on VSCode as their primary editor.

## Recommended Text Editor - VSCode

VSCode is a great text editor for writing code. It has a wide range of extensions
for working with most programming languages, along with a great community.

It’s free, open source, and the most widely used editor among developers today.

## Integrated Development Environment - WebStorm

WebStorm is an "IDE" or "Integrated Development Environment" for writing code. It
has a ton of great features, but it has cost for professional usage.

If you end up working in a professional setting or on large TypeScript codebases,
WebStorm offers excellent TypeScript tooling, refactoring, and project navigation
features that some developers find worth the investment.
