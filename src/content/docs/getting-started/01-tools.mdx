The first step to writing code is snsuring you have the proper
tools installed.

## Text Editors
<Aside type="tip">
    You can use just about any text editor for writing code, but some are better suited
    than others.
</Aside>

### VSCode

VSCode is a great text editor for writing code. It has a wide range of extensions 
for working with most programming languages, along with a great community.

It is the most popular text editor for writing code, and is free to use.

[Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### WebStorm

WebStorm is an "IDE" or "Integrated Development Environment" for writing code. It
has a ton of great features, but it has cost for profressional usage.

The learning curve is steeper than VSCode, but WebStorm is very popular among developers.

## Version Control (Git)

### What is Git?
Git is the industry standard version control system. It is free to use, and has many
online services for storing your code.

It is crucial to use version control of some kind for most if not all projects - its
easy to make mistakes, and being in the habit of using version control (and committing often)
will go a long way towards building a safety net for yourself.

### Why use Git?
You will work with git in "repositories", which can contain one project, parts of a single project, or an entire set of projects - there are pros and cons to each way of setting it up. 
Each repository consists of "commits", individual units of work that contain
a set of changes to your repository. These changes can include adding, moving, deleteing, or modifying the files in your repository,
it is considered a good practice to commit often to prevent losing work.

When you are working with others, you will all be working in the same repository, which is where _branches_ come in. Each commit
is aware of it's parents, and "merge" commits take 2 parent commits to produce one results. It is important to note that when you
"clone" a repository, you are actually setting up another instance of the repository locally, and then linking your local copy to the remote repository.




<Aside type="tip">
    A great tool for visualizing commit graphs is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). 
    It is free to use for public repositories, and is a great way to get comfortable with git concepts before
    working with the command line directly.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); grid-gap: 2rem">
    <section>
        This is a common visualization of a repository - the commit graph. Each node represents a commit, and the lines between them
        represent the parents of each commit.

        In this example, we have the "main" branch which provides the initial commit, and 2 new branches. Each branch has it's own
        commits, and the "main" branch is the parent to both of the new branches.

        When work is completed on each branch, they are _merged_ back into the "main" branch.

    </section>
    <Git branches={[{ commitCount: 3 }, { commitCount: 2 } ]}/>
</div>

### Git Repository Hosting

It is crucial to host your repositories online, as it provides a safe place to store your code. Common places to host your repositories are
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).


#### GitHub

GitHub is a great place to host your code, and is free to use. It is the most popular git repository host, and a solid choice
for anybody. You can create your first repository [here](https://github.com/)


#### GitLab

GitLab is another popular repository host, and focuses on verbose project planning and DevOps functionality. If you aren't sure
if you need those things, and you haven't already started using GitLab, I would recommend starting with GitHub.
