Version control is the practice of tracking changes to files over time. It is a key
part of any software development process, and is required for most projects.

Properly using version control helps prevent permanent loss of work, and makes it
easier to collaborate on projects with others.

The most popular version control system is called **Git**.

Git is the industry standard version control system. It is free to use, and has many
online services for storing your code.

## Understanding Git

### Repositories

You will work with git in "repositories", which can contain one project, parts of a single project,
or an entire set of projects - there are pros and cons to each way of setting it up.

For this course, we will keep all of our code in one repository, containing the code for all of our projects.

### Commits

A commit represents a unit of work that contains a set of changes to your repository. More concretely, each commit
contains changes (modification, addition, deletion) to one or more files in your repository. By looking the repository
history, you can see all of the changes that have been made to your repository - you can also rewind to any point in the past,
or "revert" commits to undo a specific set of changes.

### Branches

Each commit has a parent, and can be considered a child of it's parent commit. 
A single commit can have many children, but will only have one or two parents. Commits with two parents are called "merge" commits,
and are the result of merging two branches together.

A branch is a collection of commits that share a common parent. Every repository starts with one initial commit, 
and then branches are created from that commit. When work is completed on a branch, it is _merged_ back into the "main" branch.


## Putting it all together

    If this is getting a little heady and abstract, don't worry - vizualizing commit graphs is a great way to get comfortable with git concepts.
</Aside>

Each repository consists of "commits", individual units of work that contain
a set of changes to your repository. These changes can include adding, moving, deleteing, or modifying 
the files in your repository, it is considered a good practice to commit often to prevent losing work.

When you are working with others, you will all be working in the same repository, which is where _branches_ come in. Each commit
is aware of it's parents, and "merge" commits take 2 parent commits to produce one results. It is important to note that when you
"clone" a repository, you are actually setting up another instance of the repository locally, and then linking your local copy to the remote repository.

<Aside type="tip">
    A great tool for visualizing commit graphs is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). 
    It is free to use for public repositories, and is a great way to get comfortable with git concepts before
    working with the command line directly.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); grid-gap: 2rem">
    <section>
        This is a common visualization of a repository - the commit graph. Each node represents a commit, and the lines between them
        represent the parents of each commit.

        In this example, we have the "main" branch which provides the initial commit, and 2 new branches. Each branch has it's own
        commits, and the "main" branch is the parent to both of the new branches.

        When work is completed on each branch, they are _merged_ back into the "main" branch.
